## Getting Started Ruby 

**The project comes with Rubocop a Ruby Linter**

- **To get a local copy of the repository please run the following commands on your terminal:**
- **$ git clone https://github.com/...**
- **$ cd to/cloned/path**
- **$ git checkout branch_name**
- **$ run `bundle install`**
- **$ run `ruby main.rb`**

## Getting Started PostgreSQL

- **Create a database, you can follow the [getting started](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-start.html) section on the PSQL website**
- **Access your created database**
- **Run \i  path/schema.sql to create the tables**
- **Note: Be careful if you're copying the path from windows explorer as the path will be written as "drive:\path\to\folder\file_name.sql" and you'll likely get a "permission denied" error, use slashes instead of backslashes for the file address as in "\i drive:/path/to/folder/file_name.sql"**
